The project interacts with a game database using the IGDB API. Users can fetch detailed information about games and get recommendations for similar games based on the created game network. 
Starting the program, it will display a welcome message and synchronize the progress of loading the data and creating the network. After the network is prepared, it will prompt the user to get detailed information about a game or get game recommendations. The id or the name of the game is required for both options. The user can get the game's name, platforms, genres and themes by choosing the first option. If the user chooses to get similar game recommendations, the program will offer a list of ten most similar games. The user can request more detailed information about any of the recommended games by inputting the rank of the game. Besides, after each action, users are asked if they wish to continue using the program or exit. And users can quit the program by entering 'q' at any point.
To run the program, valid client_id and client_secret from IGDB are needed, and an authorization token needs to be generated. Those are used to fetch game data from IGDB API. To save time, you can download my data folder, which contains the fetched data, and put the folder in the same directory with the python file, the program will then be able to execute.
The required Python packages to run the project are requests and pandas.
In the game network, each node represents a game, characterized by unique attributes such as game ID, name, platforms, companies involved, genres, themes, and keywords. The edges between nodes represent the connection between games based on shared attributes. I assigned connection points to different attributes. Specifically, keywords are less important thus are assigned with 1 connection point, other shared attributes, including platforms, involved companies, genres, themes, are assigned with 2 connection points. Every same attribute between two games will add the connection points, which defines the strength of relationship between the games.
